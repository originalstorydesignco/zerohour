# This Is Zero Hour

Zero Hour is a youth led climate action organization

## OUR VISION
Enough is enough. We, the youth, believe that #ThisIsZeroHour to act on climate change. We cannot afford to wait any longer for adults to protect our right to the clean and safe environment, the natural resources we need to not just survive, but flourish. We know that we are the leaders we have been waiting for!

We believe that every individual, from every community should have access to clean air, water, and public lands. We believe in putting the needs and health of our communities before corporate gain.

We believe that the leadership of youth in this space is essential since we have inherited a crisis that we had no hand in creating. We will strive to hold our adults and elected officials accountable for their legacy of destruction and inaction when it comes climate change. We believe in a solutions-based approach that addresses the real needs of our communities.

While climate change is a phenomenon that will impact all of us —if it has not already—we believe that the impact of the climate crisis is profoundly unequal. Frontline communities across the globe and within the United States have been directly impacted by climate change to a degree greater than others. We believe, however, that those closest to the problem are also often closest to the solution. These communities have been actively working to create just solutions and transitions. Our goal is to center the unique wisdom, experience, and leadership of these communities in our efforts to make impactful change.

We also recognize that a movement for climate and environmental justice cannot be successful without building meaningful coalitions and cross-sector alignment with other movements for social justice. We believe in harnessing the power of youth-led organizing and leadership by youth from different backgrounds and experiences in forging our path towards a more equitable and safe future for all of us.
