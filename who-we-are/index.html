		<h3 class="fontsize25em red-black uppercase">Our Story</h3>
		<p class="black-red"><span>Zero Hour started out as one teen girl with a vision.</span> It was the summer of 2017, (then)15-year-old activist, community organizer, author, and soon-to-be high school sophomore Jamie Margolin was fed up with her generation being left out of the climate conversation, and her leaders treating the climate crisis like a non-emergency.</p>
		<p>She had a vision of strategic youth-led-and-centered mobilization to bring youth to the center of the climate conversation, educating leaders about what it actually takes to solve the climate crisis, and making leaders unable to ignore the issue any longer.</p>
		<p><span>And then a handful of youth with a vision.</span></p>

		<p>Starting in late summer of 2017, there were (and still are) constant calls between these determined youth, from New York City to Princeton, from Baltimore to Seattle to Phoenix. Constant notes, drawings, and ideas were sent back and forth. Late night calls, sketches, emails, research took over these young people’s lives as they worked to realize the vision.</p>
		<p>They found adult mentors to bring onto the team to help guide them.</p>
		<p>Mrinalini Chakraborty</p>
		<p>Laura Sanders</p>
		<p>It was an overwhelming amount of work to pull off and people were joining the team and dropping out of it as school started and the challenges of being a busy teenager caught up with them.</p>
		<p>The founding members were exhausted and frustrated but they were not going to give up. They knew their mission was necessary, so they kept pushing forward.</p>
		<p>They reached out far and wide, constantly on phone calls and email chains with other organizations, spreading their vision.</p>
		<p><span>And then a team of youth with a vision.</span> Slowly, more youth began to join and become leaders, taking on the vision and making it their own.</p>

		<p>Bella Munson</p>
		<p>Danny</p>
		<p>Jasilyn</p>
		<p>Shraddha</p>
		<p>Ava</p>
		<p>Talia</p>
		<p>More adult mentors started to show up.</p>
		<p>Jordan</p>
		<p>Amanda</p>
		<p>They split into teams and began working on tackling all the tasks that would need to be done in order to make this vision a reality.</p>
		<p>On every team, youth were in the lead, the adults only there to give input and help with technicalities.</p>
		<p>Now there was a full fledged team determined to lift the voices of youth.</p>
		<p>In late January of 2018 a few key members of the core team traveled to Washington DC to lay groundwork, make more connections, learn about what the rest of the environmental advocacy world was up to  ---- and meet each other in person for the very first time:</p>

		<p>The Zero Hour team had become more than just an organization- we were a family:</p>
		<p>Photos</p>
		<p>We’ve been growing more and working more ever since- but our story is not complete.</p>
		<p>You can be a part of our family too. The movement depends on youth like yourself- and adults like you willing to support and uplift youth- making this vision your own. Join us and let’s write the next chapter of our story together. </p>
